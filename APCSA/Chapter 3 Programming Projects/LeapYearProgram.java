/*
Program asks user to enter a year from the Gregorian calendar (after 1582). User enters a year, program tells the person if it is a leap year or not. 
The program should repeat over and over until the user enters a sentinel value to end the program. Leap years only exist after 1582, so if the year 
isnâ€™t bigger then that it should re-prompt the user. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not 400.
