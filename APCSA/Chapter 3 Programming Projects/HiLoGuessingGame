/*Program randomly generates a value between 1 and 100. User then guesses it. 
Ask user to enter a number between 1 and 100. Tell them if their guess was too hi or lo.
Keep asking until they get the correct number. Report the # of guesses
Allow user to give up with a sentinel value (but feel free to make fun of them if they quit)
If user gets correct #, ask if they want to play again. */
