/*THE DIRECTIONS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT
 * With single System.out.println statements, output the following: 

1. 
Descartes said: 
“I think, therefore I am”

2.
The backslash (\) is a typographical mark (“glyph”) used mainly in computing.

3. 
Create your own that is over-the-top-ridiculous-silly, but highlights the idea. 

When done: Put a multi-line comment into your program explaining the different useful escape sequences so you can look back at this file in the future.
